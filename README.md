## Project Overview

The three-point shot has become one of the most important elements of modern NBA offense. 
This project analyzes historical NBA data to understand how three-point shooting has evolved across teams, players, and positions.

The analysis focuses on identifying key trends in shooting volume, efficiency, and player roles.

## Key Questions

- How has the use of the three-point shot evolved since its introduction in 1979?
- Has three-point efficiency improved as attempts increased?
- How many players attempt high volumes of three-point shots per game?
- How have different player positions adapted to the modern three-point game?

## Project Workflow

1. Raw NBA statistics were collected and stored in a database.
2. SQL queries were used to clean and prepare the data. 📄 [View the Data Curation Report](reports/2_Data_Curation.pdf)
3. Exploratory data analysis was performed to identify trends in three-point shooting. 📄 [View the EDA Report](reports/3_EDA.pdf)
4. Visualizations were created in Tableau to highlight key insights.
5. Results were compiled into an EDA report.
6. Datafolio were created as a project summary.
7. Dashboard were created and published in Tableau.
8. Final report were redacted with every insight and coclusion of the project.
