# NBA 3-Point Evolution Analysis

This project explores how the use of the three-point shot in the NBA has evolved since its introduction during the season 1979-80. 
Using SQL for analysis and Tableau for visualization, the project examines changes in league strategy, player behavior, and positional roles over time.

## Project Overview

The three-point shot has become one of the most important elements of modern NBA offense. 
This project analyzes historical NBA data to understand how three-point shooting has evolved across teams, players, and positions.

The analysis focuses on identifying key trends in shooting volume, efficiency, and player roles.

## Key Questions

- How has the use of the three-point shot evolved since its introduction in 1979?
- Has three-point efficiency improved as attempts increased?
- How many players attempt high volumes of three-point shots per game?
- How have different player positions adapted to the modern three-point game?

## Project Workflow

1. Raw NBA statistics were collected and stored in a database.
2. SQL queries were used to clean and prepare the data. 📄 [View the Data Curation Report](reports/2_Data_Curation.pdf)
3. Exploratory data analysis was performed to identify trends in three-point shooting. 
4. Visualizations were created in Tableau to highlight key insights.
5. Results were compiled into an EDA report. 📄 [View the EDA Report](reports/3_EDA.pdf)
6. Datafolio was created as a project summary. 📄 [View Datafolio](images/Datafolio/three_point_evolution.pdf)
7. Dashboard was created and published in Tableau. 👉 [View on Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/views/NBA_3P_Evolution/3PEvolution?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
